# Smart_Aquarium_Controller
The Smart Aquarium Controller uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU to automate aquarium monitoring. It controls temperature with a DHT sensor, activating a fan or heater, and checks water quality using a TDS sensor. A servo motor dispenses food via the Blynk app, enabling remote control and real-time management of aquarium conditions.
